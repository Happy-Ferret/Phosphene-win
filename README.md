Phosphene_win
=============

A windows port of hdni's amazing Gnome theme: https://github.com/hdni/Phosphene

Still WIP, at the moment I there is not much besides a TrueTransparency theme and an almost finished foobar theme.
I'll add an installation guide when the theme is in a more finished state.
